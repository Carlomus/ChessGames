     So the
speedrun definitely is getting more
interesting     and the
games have a lot more meat on the
bone. We're
1355. Hopefully we get
a couple games with Black so we can really
flesh out some, uh, accelerated
dragon theory. Let's roll the
cameras. Hope you guys can hear hear me
fine. Let me know, because I m always want
to make sure that when I do YouTube videos,
the sound is okay. So if I'm peeking or
something, let me know.     But
it should be good. Singular
1400. And we're facing
the English c four.
Now, my recommendation
against one D Four is going to
be well, I actually haven't decided yet
whether I'm recommending the King's Indian
or the GRUNFELD. I'm leaning toward
recommending the GRUNFELD as my
official recommendation against 
 one D Four
openings.   Now against C four,
if you want to be a principal to
Andy, you have to learn E
Five, right? So the
way that I'm building this opening
repertoire for you in the speed run, I'm
trying to teach you the most principled
lines, the lines that are going to annoy
your opponent the most. And even if
your rating is on the lower side,
you want to avoid taking opening
shortcuts, right? And it's easy
to take a shortcut and say, hey, I'm a
Queen's gamma declined player. I'm going to
go e six and d five here. Absolutely nothing
wrong with that. But if you want to play
principal chess, the move that really takes
it to White is E Five. And here there's a
fork in the road, which we'll talk about
after the game. Uh, I'll give you a little
bit of context on English opening
theory. Of course, you can think of this as
a reversed closed Sicilian. So
NZ three is the main move. And
here, once again, black has a
bunch of different viable setups.
There's the move Bishop, F Eight to B Four,
which, if you've watched my blitz games,
you'll notice that I play this move almost
exclusively, but it leads to some
incredibly complex positional
struggles. And I think a simpler
line, a more approachable line
for players of intermediate level,
is just to develop the knight, for now, to F
Six. This does not commit to any
system of development in particular. Well,
that's not totally true. It, uh,
prevents us from pushing our pawn to F Five,
which constitutes a rather
ambitious but viable
response to the English. So
we're precluding the possibility of F Five.
And here, once again, another fork in the
road for Black. There's a bunch of
different possibilities. Here, we're going
to play the move D Five, uh, in
this game, reaching a reverse
accelerated dragon. That's really how you
should think of this opening. It's an
accelerated dragon where White is an extra
tempo, and of course, black
is playing white.  
There's, of course, the move Bishop Before
here as well, which is similar to
Bishop before in the previous move.
You can just continue developing with knight
C six. But after the game, I
will show you a typical scenario that
often happens to players who are not
familiar with English theory. The dangerous
thing about this setup from Black's
perspective is that if you just develop your
pieces without a second thought, if you
just put your pieces on natural squares very
often, you actually end up getting under
serious positional pressure. And I'll give
you a couple of examples of that after the
game. So, in this case, we are going to play
the most principled move, which is
D. I'm going to
write down some stuff to not
forget it. Show 
  examples
of    
misplaying.    
All right? And obviously, we take
back with the knight   
      and
Bishop G two. So our opponent continues
to follow the natural path.
Now, here you might be
tempted extrapolating
from,  uh, the theory of the accelerated
dragon to play the move Bishop E
six. But it's important to remember that we
are down at Tempo. So Bishop E six here
is actually inaccurate, I think, for
several reasons. Uh, but most
importantly, it allows white to
strike   with an
early D, which leads
to tension in the center that black
is not entirely prepared for, because black
is the one down at Tempo. So the move here,
it's not C six either, because, again, C six
allows D four. We want to play a clever
move that prevents D four and increases
our clamp on the D four square. In
fact, the battle is going to revolve in the
opening largely around our
ability to prevent, first and foremost, the
D pawn break. And that is
why we drop our night back to B six.
We also don't take on C three because
that trade in the
Sicilian and by extension, in the reverse
Sicilian, plays right into White's hands. It
increases white's control of the center
and it helps white push D four, and
it opens the B file, which you might
notice there is a B seven pawn that the
Bishop is already pressuring night F three.
We obviously respond with Knight two, C six
defending the pawn and once again preventing
D four.   And then our
dark squared Bishop.   In
such positions. A little context for
people watching on YouTube. I just played a
long blitz session, and I was talking
about how a lot of chess GMs and
commentators, they like to use the phrase
in such positions, especially with the
Russian acts, okay? In such
positions,    these bones
and in such pasdians, the plan is typical.
Yeah. Okay. And I think it's an overrated
phrase because even the players and people
who use that phrase don't exactly know what
it means.   Um, so
in such positions, the dark squad Bishop
belongs on E seven. In this precise
position, the darkscored Bishop
belongs on E seven and only on
E seven. What are the other possibilities of
development? Well, we could play Bishop D
six, but once again, I'm a broken record but
Bishop D six walks right into D
four. Now, the move bishop C
five is harder to refute, and it might make
sense from a logical standpoint, right?
You're just making it even harder for White
to push D four. But the bishop on C five,
you might notice, is vulnerable to
several different things. First and
foremost, there's this idea of playing A
three, B four that you should be familiar
with if you're a Sicilian player. There's
also, uh, the annoying night jump
to E four. A white could also
put the queen on C two and X ray the bishop.
So you should notice that the bishop on C
five just is a little bit unsafe. And
so we want to develop a little bit more
modestly here with bishop E seven, all
right? And then we want a
castle. And then we want to bring
the other bishop out
usually to E six, as
White often does in the
Sicilian. Of course, you could also bring it
out to G four. But the bishop on
G four in such positions
doesn't really do anything. And when I say
in such positions here, I mean positions
with a fee and ketoed bishop, right? You
could play Bishop g four. But it's a paper
tiger that pin is not dangerous at
all. White plays e three.
Okay? So here it's important to talk about
the idea, uh, of changed
circumstances, right? I just talked a lot.
I talked up a storm about the
importance of preventing D
four. So extrapolating from that, you
might say, hey, E three threatens D four.
Well, let's stop D four at all costs. And
you might come up with an idea like queen to
D three. Or you might say. Well, let's go.
Bishop G. Four. Let's try to pin this knight
to make D four as difficult as possible.
But pawn moves change the
structure. And so you have to reassess the
danger level of these ideas when
the structure changes. And what you might
notice is that after White plays D four
in this version,  that's
not nearly as dangerous as it was just a
couple of moves ago. Because here we trade
on D four. White has to
recapture with the pawn eventually.
And what kind of structure do we reach
as a result? Well, that's called the
IQP structure, the isolated queen
pond structure. And a shorthand
way of evaluating who's better in
an IQ structure is to see who
controls the square in front of the
isolated queen pawn and just to look
to see whether the side with the
isolated pawn has attacking chances
against the opposing side's king, which is
often the appeal of flying an
IQP structure. And here, in both
cases,   this, uh,  position favors
us    in queen D three, by the way. Not a
bad move at all. Not a bad move at all. It's
a high level move. But in this game, we're
going to play it simple, and we're actually
going to allow the move D four. And what I'm
going to attempt to show you is that in the
resulting position, we control the D five
square   and we control
the keys to the kingdom. Our opponent
confidently blitzes out D
four. We take on D four, and of course,
whitekit can take back with a knight, but
we're just going to trade knights. And
potentially we're even going to trade
queens. I'm not totally sure we're going to
trade queens. There what we'll see. We'll
cross that bridge if we get there.
But, um,  our opponent takes back with a
pawn. I actually think knight takes D four
might have been the only
clear path to equality for White. And I'll
show you guys why afterward. What is
the key move in this position? It's
harder to shoot at a moving target. Remember
that. And it's important to pile up on the
square in front of the IQP. So what
developing move   fits
the bill here? Well, if we play
95 immediately, right, it's
less important to occupy the square than it
is to control it. And don't confuse
occupying a square with controlling it.
These are two separate things. If you play
95, what you're allowing is knight
takes D five, queen takes D five, and then a
night jump to E five, opening up a discovery
on the queen. And things get really
unpleasant. We kind of slip away from the
ledge. The move is bishop E six. Bishop
to F six is interesting. You're
attacking the pawn, but you're still
allowing the pawn to push forward to D five.
Now, you might say, hey, in that position,
you have night before. And I agree, bishop F
six is actually a great move here. But we're
trying to play sort of
strict positional chess. I'm trying to play
by the rules, kind of lack of
creativity. And that's by design.
So hopefully we'll get a chance to outplay
our opponent in this position. So we have
achieved what we set out to do. I would
say that black is maybe only a
tiny smidge better.   Uh, maybe
the position is still even equal
because the IQP in this
case is not a big weakness for white.
White can defend it quite easily with bishop
E three. So it's not like white is losing
the spawn imminently,    um,
but it is somewhat of a liability.
Of course, white has the major asset,
as they do in the English, which is this
fiance, bishop, uh, which sits on
a very nice, long diagonal.
But our pieces are also very
nicely positioned. Everything is very
compact. Everything is close to the center.
And we've got many more ways to
improve our position. You should already,
just by looking at this for a couple of
moments, identify a
bunch of ways in which you
can, a, intensify the pressure
on the isolated queen pun, and
B, simply improve your position and bring
more pieces into the game. And there's kind
of a classic way to continue doing
that. What am I talking about? What's the
sort of very traditional follow up
in such positions?
There is bishop f six, once again, by the
way,    but I'm
talking about queen d seven,
and we just have to test that. Queen d 795,
we can trade. And white does get
rid of the IQP there. So that is a drawback
of queen d seven. It's the move knight to e
five in response, and then after the trade,
white takes back with a pawn. And I'm not
entirely sure what to make of the resulting
structure. So that might be
something that's worth dodging.
Maybe we should start with the move bishop
f six and hit the pawn first and control
the e five square. So let's calculate bishop
f six. I'm a little bit
concerned about this weird looking move,
knight c three to e four,
which seems to invite black to take the
pawn. On d four, we capture d four.
But if you keep calculating after knight
takes d four, knight takes d four. The night
from e four jumps into c five. That's a lot
of arrows. That's a long line.
But   at the end of the line,
the night on z four is loose. The pawn on b
seven is hanging. So that just doesn't
inspire confidence. But after
bishop f 694,
bishop takes d four, knight takes d
four, we can actually take on d four
with the queen. And the point of
inducing a queen trade is that in the
resulting position after queen d 494 95,
and this will be impressive if somebody can
get this, what is black's move in
that resulting position? Hopefully you were
able to follow along.    What's
black's move in the position after night c
five with the queen's off the board? What
does black have? It's night c two.
There's a fork on c two. And even if
you didn't visualize the line, you should
see that the rooks are on forkable squares
of blacks knight from d four jumps into
c two. And so on the basis
of this line, and I will say that at a
grandmaster level, the position is entirely
unclear.   I think our
opponent has done a phenomenal job in the
opening thus far, but
white has more at stake here.
If he goes wrong, okay, if white
makes a couple of passive moves, he's going
to slip into passive mode. Bishop e three
played. And once again, we think about
queen d seven. But yet again, queen
d seven runs into 95, unfortunately.
And after 95 d e five, we lose
the pawn on, uh, b seven at the end of the
line. So I actually still don't want to go
queeny seven. I amend what I just said.
But what we can do instead is
increase our control
   of the square in
front of the IQP. And
the more familiar you are with typical plans
in IQP structures, the more
fluent, you will be at, ah, finding these
types of ideas. What we're going to do here
is a very typical move,
knight C six to B four. And
don't be fooled by the aggressive appearance
of this move. This achieves the same
thing that 97 would achieve. It's just that
97 allows the extra option of knight F three
to G five. Right. We're keeping a very
close eye on this night on F three because
by moving it, white is opening up the long
diagonal, which could be unpleasant. Now,
uh, you might say, well, what about 95 here?
Well, 95 doesn't make contact anymore with
any of Black species, so it's less
dangerous. We can just leave that night
sitting on e five. It's not really bothering
us. And the night from B four can
drop back to D five, establishing what's
called the blockade. And once the
blockade is established, well, that's
a step in the right direction. Um,
queen C eight was a very good move,
actually. Queens C eight and rook D eight
would have put the rook on an X ray with the
White queen. Maybe it was even the best
move. I'm not claiming that I'm playing
this in the best way. So we quickly dropped
the knife back to e five. And
I think a grandmaster approach for
White would be to play knight C three to E
four and aim the knight
for this very juicy square on C
five. That's kind of annoying. And
our opponent is firing on all
cylinders. Okay, let's think.  
  I kind of like the
move queen to C eight
here with Black. Basically,
we are not so worried about dropping our
bishop. I mean, I don't love giving up the
bishop. And so bishop E seven comes
to mind. But bishop E
795 hits the bishop, hits the B seven upon
at the same time.   And that's
a little bit iffy.  So
let's actually calculate bishop P seven
NC five. Now, we can take the
bishop on e three in that
resulting position.    Then the
Rook Recaptures. Ah. Uh, and then we have
a nice little reshuffling. I think I found
something promising.   
I think I found something
promising,    but it's
complicated.    And I think
White has a way to bail out into
equality there
nonetheless.    Bishop, e seven.
Knight, C five. Knight takes e
three. Rook takes e
three.     And then we just
play bishop E six to D
five.     We can also
do this immediately. We can replace the
knight with the bishop. Knight takes E three
and then bishop D five in this position. 
 Does that idea kind of make sense? What
we're trying to do is take the sting
out of the move knight E four to C five,
which with the bishop already on, um, D
five, no longer carries a threat.
So I actually think this might be the
simplest approach, but we're going to
start see, the problem with knight takes e
three is that it allows f takes C three, and
White essentially on IQPs
his pawn. This is a positive pawn
structure transformation for White. We're
going to play Bishop p seven. I need to
accelerate my pace just a little bit. I'm
running off at the mouth here.   Um,
   so we're going to wait for
knight C five and then play Knight takes C
three. And the idea of switching the move
order like that is that in that position, if
White plays Fe three, we can snap the knight
off the board and ruin White's pawn
structure permanently. Bishop takes C five,
DC, and then the knight can jump
into C four and start harassing a bunch of
White's pawns. The position remains
extremely unclear there, but it seems
to me that black has perhaps a
slightly easier game.  
 So, yeah, this is
definitely thus far. There was one
guy we played in a rosalimo, if you
remember, a couple of videos
ago, where our opponent basically hung
with me on equal terms for most of the
game. And thus far, I
have to give major props to my opponent.
  Black is not better here. I
think I misvaluated this slightly. I was a
little over optimistic based on the
fact that we have control of the square in
front of the IQP, but my opponent is
convincing me otherwise.  What White is
doing so expertly is using the
IQP and making the most of it right. When
you've got a weak pawn, you have to
compensate for that with active piece
play. And this is precisely what White is
doing. White is playing very actively, doing
everything he can to disrupt the
coordination of our pieces. And this
is almost a blunder, but it's
not. Oh, my gosh. Night G
five. So it looks like a blunder. Why?
Because knight takes E three snaps off the
defender of the G five knight. But our
opponent sees Knight takes E six in
return, which leads to more
complications. Knight takes D eight, knight
takes D one, night takes D eight. And if
Knight takes B two, the knight takes on B
seven, and White is okay. So one simple
option for black here is to play knight
takes E three, night takes C six, take the
queen, and then simply take the knight on D
eight. And after rookie takes D one,
we play the move like C six, and perhaps
black is just a tiny bit better, but that's
going to be a tough end game to win. That's
going to be a tough end game into one. The
alternative in this position is, of course,
to play Bishop F five. What we do not want
to allow is Knight takes C six.
And this is a tough decision even for me. So
let me think about this for a second. 
 I like the look of Bishop F
five. I feel like Knight G five is a paper
tiger. I feel like this is a paper
tiger. And I think we should keep the pieces
on the board.   
Let's give it a shot. I don't see a follow
up for White. I think White
has succumbed
slightly to one movie
and has granted us an important
tempo because now,
of course, Nike C Three is a massive threat,
actually. Very easy to blunder, right? Very
easy to forget that this is a move, because
our opponent might fall into the illusion
that, oh, the knight on D Five is our
strongest piece, so we're not going to give
it away. Very common reason for
blunders. When you make a
positional assumption, oh, one piece is
stronger than another, so the trade is
not going to happen. Right? I think you kind
of see what I'm saying, but you fail to
evaluate the position concretely
and to see that the trade is warranted for
tactical reasons.  
   Now, White is experiencing
some logistical problems here
because     apart from Knight
Takes E Three, both of our bishops are
making contact with both of our opponents
knights, which is not a pleasant scenario
for White.   The best move
here for White and, and it's not an easy
move for, you know, for, for a,
for a newer player to play and not because,
you know, not trying to to condescend. This
is just an objectively difficult thing to do
is just to kind of make a Zen
move like Bishop E Three back
to C One. And I think this is what White
should actually play. And the point is to
prevent Knight Take C Three. And if we play
H Six in that position, which we very well
might, then I just drops back to F three and
there we go, right? I kind of called it.
Our opponent just collapses. He's
unable to deal with everything that's
going on in short circuits and
gives us a free piece. We have several
ways to win the piece. We can play Knight
takes C three because the knight on G five
is literally now hanging.  
But while we're at it
and White is going to get a pawn for the
piece, right? What we don't want to do is
play Bishop Takes G Five first. That would
be a huge mistake  because then if you
look very carefully,  
well, actually, maybe we can get away with
that move. But white as night takes g five.
Oh, actually, that's an interesting idea.
No, it doesn't work.   Bishop takes G five.
Knight takes D five. Knight takes D
five. Bishop takes G five. And our
queen is overextended. We're going to end up
giving back the knight on D Five. So
let's play it simple and let's do what we
originally intended and just play Knight
takes you three. And yes, we are allowed
allowing White to improve his structure. By
the way, the same would have been the case
after Knight Takes C three. It would have
done the other thing on the other side,
leading to what's called a hanging pawn
structure. But what I like here is that we
have the bishop pair. I love that we have
the bishop pair, and we have an extra
bishop, and we have an extra dark squirt
bishop. And the reason that's important is
because the pawn on E three has now become a
target. Essentially, the target has shifted
one file to the left from the
IQP to now the pawn on E three, which can be
easily targeted with a knight from C
four, with a rook from E eight. And if we
can get White to play E four,
another kind of, 
uh, idea that a lot of players will
stumble on, they think, oh, this is an
intimidating move. No, it's not, because
now, once again, the target has shifted, and
again the target has shifted to the D four
pawn. White's center may seem
imposing, but it's actually a massive
liability. We have an extra piece, and we
can easily use our minor pieces to harass
White's Center and provoke more weaknesses.
But we got to be careful about how we do it.
The careless bishop G six actually loses
the piece. Who can tell me why? What happens
after bishop G six? And don't worry, I will
speed up just a little bit here in the late
middle game, which means I might not explain
as thoroughly, but these
couple next moves are still important.  
What happens after bishop back to G six?
Yeah, h four. And we're going to have
to sack our bishop for two pawns, because if
we move our bishop back there, white can
actually throw in E five and then H five.
And we want to avoid that with
a ten foot pull.  
Yeah, we do. So instead, we
should move the bishop on this diagonal. Uh,
 where should we go? Well, we can go back to
E six, but then that allows D five with
tempo. So I think we shouldn't hesitate to
play what may seem like an awkward move.
Actually, the more I look at this, I think
bishop C eight was actually the best move.
Just drop the bishop back to its initial
square, but leave open the queen's contact
with the D four pawn. And later on, we're
going to redeploy that bishop as necessary.
Bishop D seven is also good. We're up a
piece, for goodness sakes. And this has the
benefit of being able to put the bishop on C
six in the event that White pushes
the EPON, which, knowing
player around 1400, I think he might be
tempted by E five. I also think he might be
very tempted by the one Mvitas move, H ah
four, which is no longer dangerous and which
will send our bishop back to E seven. Big
whoop. Right? Our pieces are temporarily a
little bit passive,     so what's
going to be our our kind, uh, of
broad plan here? It's hard to talk
about a plan because the position is very
volatile. Right. It can change in a variety
of ways. And that will, in turn, change our
approach, why I can push the deep pawn or
the ePawn or why you can play on the King
side. So it doesn't make sense
here to come up with a specific plan for
Black. But on a broad level, the way
in which we can improve our position
is, uh, to make moves
such as C Six,
Queen C Seven, and bring the rooks
into the game. I think that's an important
step, which all plans are going to share in
common, is that the rooks, ultimately,
we're going to try to put on D Eight and on
E eight to create the backbone
of the pressure that we're ultimately going
to put on White's Center pawns.
We're also going to be very attentive
to the moment that White pushes one of the
center pawns. The moment he does so, it
creates weaknesses, square
weaknesses. If White plays z five,
we can take out the fianceto. Bishop.
With bishop c six. Okay. 92 is
super passive, and it's not imposing at all.
And this gives us a chance to really take
the initiative away from White's hands. We
have a super high level positional move
here, which we're going to make, and I'm
going to explain the logic behind it. Now,
first thing I see is that 92 has a concrete
drawback. Okay, what is its concrete
drawback? Well, it allows a check on E
three, which I know some of you guys are
seeing, but the check
alone isn't that effective. Bishop B
Three. King h one. But you can combine
that check with an idea that
aims at chipping away at White
Center. Right. You can ship away
at White Center, and I call this carving
out. What you're doing is you're provoking a
pawn move in order to create
a a weakness on a color complex. In this
case, obviously, the color
complex we want to weaken are, uh, the dark
squares because we have an extra dark
squared bishop. So how do we induce a
weakness on the dark square complex?  
What we need to provoke is the move
D. If we provoke
that move, what I want you to notice is
that all of these dark squares in the center
become really weak, particularly the E Five
square, which can be used as an outpost for
either the knight or the Bishop. So how do
we provoke White into playing D Five?
There's a couple of ways to do it, but there
is one super classy tactical move that we
can play, and some of you are already
seeing it. I did not mention Bishop E
three by accident. This
plays an integral role in the tactical
justification.  It's not Bishop C Six,
because that doesn't actually create any
threats.    It is the move. C
seven. C Five.    
And of course, the tactical
part is that if White plays DC,
we fork the pawn with our
Bishop, bishop E three, we can recapture it,
and you might. Say, well, why is that good?
Well, that's good because it trades upon it.
It opens up the center, and when you're up a
piece, that's exactly what you want. We have
achieved what we want here, and we have two
approaches. We can occupy the square
with our bishop. We can play bishop F Six,
or we can play the sexy looking
night C Four and throw
a knight onto E five, which looks absolutely
fantastic. And that's actually what we're
going to do. Let's go night C four,
and we're keeping the bishop on G five.
Maybe Bishop E three will come in handy.
I think night C Four is more flexible and
it's more aggressive, and it should be self
evident to all of you why the night on E
five is such a monster piece. An
outpost like that just sits on the
position. It makes it impossible for White
to do anything. It takes the bishop
on G two entirely out of
commission. And you're
beginning to see, hopefully, why it is that
people make such a big fuss out of weakening
squares and weakening complexes of
squares. And a square complex is just a
set of dark squares. In this case, the
complex is in the center, right?
E five is weak, but also E three is weak
and D four is weak. And B Two,
one could argue, is weak as well.
So it's the set of dark squares in the
center that White has weakened.
And so by occupying it, we
hold the keys to the kingdom. We hold total
dominance over the board. Again,
if you're newer and you're watching this, I
don't really understand how this square
thing works. You don't really need to. What
you need to know right now is that square
control is important, and you sort of
need to familiarize yourself with the
concept of a square complex. Okay? So an
important moment has occurred. Let's forget
about this pawn for a second. I'm not
interested in that pond. What I'm interested
in is to prevent the move E four, E five,
because that's how a square complex weakness
is eradicated, right? You push a pawn onto
the square, and you sever our
control over that square. So we can do a
couple of things. We can play the move 95
and literally put our knight on E five.
That's the simple idea. But what I really
like is actually now to drop our bishop back
to F six. Okay? Again, we're trying to keep
maximum flexibility. We're keeping the night
on C four for the time being. Maybe we'll
drop it back to E five, but also we're
attacking B two, and if White gives us a
chance, I mean, we might take it with our
bishop and Jeffrey in the chat, by way.
Thank you for that. We have Jeffrey Jean,
uh, leading American grandmaster,
participating in the chat live. So
I feel the need to step up my own
game, which is awesome.
    Um, so big shout
out. If you're watching on YouTube, make
sure to follow. I'm going to shamelessly
Shield. Jeffrey's New. Uh, twitch
stream. Twitch TV shakes Totally
worth the follow.    You see, I'm totally
corrupt. I just promote my friends and
that's it. People don't realize I'm not
interested in ExpressVPN
   because friends get priority.
Knight to d three. Okay, so what do we do
now? Well, first, we identify the threat.
The threat is obviously E five. We have a
gazillion ways that we can
meet this threat. You
guys are probably thinking, let's go night
E five. But we're going to do it in a
slightly more classy manner. Okay,
what we're going to do well,
what we're going to do is something very
obvious, and you should see this
possibility. There's a pawn. That
pawn is hanging. And this will take a little
bit of calculation. What pawn is hanging?
Well, knight takes B two, right? Knight
takes b two. Let's calculate. Can white play
e five. No, because white loses the
queen. So after Night takes B two, which
we're going to play white has to recapture.
Then we recapture with the bishop. Can
white play e five. No, because the rook is
hanging. But you might say, but rugby one,
and we're going to lose the B seven pawn.
Well, don't panic. First of all, you can
lose that pawn and still be up a piece and
still be winning. So after night B two,
bishop B two, rugby, uh,   one,  
you can very well play bishop E five.
And what we have done by taking on
B two is created a past pawn on C
four. And don't
  fall under the misconception that
past pawns cannot be promoted in the
middle game. They very well can
be, and they will be. And I'm
tempted to go for this line just to show you
that. But the clinical approach, if you
really want it to be greedy, is to
drop the bishop back to D four.
And after king H one, who can tell me a
move that
simultaneously defends the B seven pawn
and prevents the move? E five.
We're not going to do this. We are going to
go bishop E five here because it's the
simpler approach. Excellent. Dark tiger.
Got it. Queen c seven. Guys, b
six does not stop E five. Right? You only
check one box. The move is queen C seven,
right? It stops E five, and it defends B
seven. But much simpler is just to say, I
don't care about this pawn. I care about
this pawn. So let's take what
is white actually doing on B seven,
right? This is an area of
improvement for a lot of players where they
look at a piece like the rook and they say,
well, I need to get rid of the rook. Let's
go. Bishop c eight. Let's go. Queen c eight.
You don't need to do either of these things
because the rook in and of itself is not
actually exerting any serious pressure.
We don't need to go rugby eight.
We literally just want to push the pawn.
Here we go c four. And then once we go c
three, the pawn is forever anchored to the
bishop. You should think of this as a
checkpoint, right? It's like a
checkpoint in a video game or a computer
game where you hit a spot
and basically you can die, but you'll go
back to that spot. So the pawn on c
three is permanently anchored by the bishop.
Let's get it there, and then let's reassess
the situation.      
The bishop is undefended. Yes. Okay. Queen
h five. Big deal, right? Another one
move threat that we don't need to fear at
all. All we need to do here is
secure the bishop, right? How do we secure
the bishop? Well, we have a nice way to do
it. The best way to defend a piece is with a
pawn. So that should be your default rookie
eight. Defends it with a piece, and it
weakens the f seven. Pawn don't like it
the f six. Now, you might look at this
move and say, hey, but first of all, ben
feingold. Second of all, are we not worried
about weakening the 7th rank?
 Well, no,
the simple answer, because white does not
have the means, the firepower to
do anything about it. Again, this bishop
on d seven, it can't even be
attacked a second time. If you look
carefully, white can't put the second rook
on the 7th ring. White can play the move
bishop g two to h three. True. But then we
just trade bishops, and we can play queen c
eight in that resulting position to force
the queen trade as well. Even if white
manages to create a main threat, god
forbid, if white gets rid of the bishop
and then plays like queen g four, that's
a one move threat. We can always put a rook
up to f uh seven if we're really worried
about the 7th rank.  So I
think what you should be focused on as
we're converting this advantage is just
the power of concrete thinking and the
importance of not being reactive in chess
and saying, oh, this is scary because
of X-Y-Z.   
  It's okay to think like that. You
have to think like that. But you also have
to look at the position very concretely
and truly understand whether something is
scary. So we take on h three, and
now we identify the rook as an
undefended piece. The queen is
always a vulnerability. Combining those
two together, we get the very
classy move queen d eight to c
eight, forcing the queen trade.
   And you might say, no, it doesn't
force the queen trade because white is rook
d seven, and our opponent might play this
move rook d seven loses the game on the
spot. And I'll let you guys think of the
reason why,   and
perhaps we could say this move in the chat.
Even if y doesn't play rook d seven, what do
we do? Stress got it first. Rook
f seven, but not rook d
eight. Rook d eight is the most popular
wrong answer. It's the right idea. But rook
takes D eight is check. It doesn't work.
Rook f seven avoids the check and wins
the rook on d seven. Okay,    so which rook
do we take with it? Doesn't really
matter, right? You can play rookfc eight.
You can play rookie C eight. But if you want
to be super classy and if you want to use
tactics to your benefit, notice that we have
the possibility of a check on D four
and that can be used in the event that White
takes a seven. So rook AC eight is the
clinical move and it
also sets a trap. Our opponent might
mindlessly grab the pawn on a seven and
allow bishop d four with a fork. 
 The actual reason I'm taking with the A
rook and I'm being super pedantic here
deliberately,  is because the other
rook can be used. For what purpose? Well, it
can be used for the purpose of smoking the
white rook out of the 7th rank with rook f
seven. And you might say but didn't you say
the rook on b seven isn't scary? Well, the
circumstances have changed. Right now our
goal is to promote the seat bond. And the
rook on b seven has just become a nuisance
because the queens are off the board. So our
sequence of events is to smoke the rook away
from B seven and then just
basically push the pawn supporting
it if necessary with both of our rooks.
And when the time is right, we're going to
use our bishop to knock white's rook off
of whatever blockading post
it's going to occupy. So, rook c one has
been played.   We can start by pushing
C three. We can actually do it in this
order. Let's do it in this order. There is
zero rush to playing rook f
seven. White still cannot take on
a seven and he just did. And that ends
the game. Okay, bishop d
four. And this is how you integrate
traps into your play, right? You talk about
tricky players. To be a
tricky player, you don't need to constantly
BS and sacrifice move quality.
If you're experienced, you can seamlessly
weave traps with the way
that you normally play. Okay, what do we
do now? Well, there's one more nuisance
to eliminate. So rather than C
two, I like the simple rook FD eight,
pick up the pawn, then go C two and go rook
d one and dislodge the rook from C one.
Make White give it away for the pond and
the rest will be easy.   
       And, uh,
you might be like, okay,   
all of these explanations in, like, the last
two minutes might have been unnecessary. But
my coaching philosophy and my
philosophy of helping people improve is
to emphasize that when you promote
the right kinds of habits in totally winning
positions, you should think of these
positions as a training ground
for building the right habits. Right. This
is a low stakes situation because
you know you're going to win the game
basically, whatever you do. Although never
underestimate people's power to,
uh, mess things up. So
    it's like
you still have to try to push
yourself to be
precise. And before you know it,
 um, you will start being
precise in more complicated positions.
      I'll let
you research the quote yourself and
figure out who he was talking about.
Okay. Rook takes c eight.  
And here comes Johnny.
Rook c two and queen h five.
And it's made no stalemate. Plenty
of pawn moves.    
The game is over.   
I miss maiden two, apparently.
Shame on me. Okay, now, the simplest
is to drive the king back to G
two, paving the way
for a check on C two. So the retreating
move, queen H five, check. Perhaps there is
a faster mate. I don't care. I see a mate.
We're going for a mate. And that a ladder
made. Queen D one is
coming to a theater near you. And that
ends the game. And that was one of our
longest games thus far, right? Around 40
moves, 39 moves.  
And it was a nice game. It was a rich
positional game. And I have to give kudos to
our opponent who played extremely well,
really, uh,  until the peace blunder
and even induced, I think, a couple of
inaccuracies. So let's delve into the
analysis and this will
be sort of a, uh, little opening
overview   on top of
a game analysis.  All right,
let me pull up chess base. So c
45. So there's many
schools of thought for how to face the
English. And it really depends
on which opening you play against E
four, right? So the first step is to ask
yourself what you play against D four. If
you're a queen's gamma declined. Player C
four is the least dangerous move against QGD
players because you can basically just play
E six. And white in many cases just
ends up going D four and transposing.
There are a couple of ways that white could
keep a unique English flavor. So
there is stuff you still need to learn. In
particular, the most common is to play this
ready, set up. With nine, F three and G
three,   white could play the move
E four. But here, after D five, you
transpose into a variation of the exchange
French that you have to learn if you want to
play this with black. But realistically,
it's not dangerous. I think this is the best
move. And black, uh,  is doing
completely fine. Now, things
get a little bit more complicated
if, for example,   
you are a let's say you're a
groonfeld player, okay?
And if you're a GRUNFELD player, just to
show everybody what the GRUNFELD is, the
GRUNFELD is when you play G
six. Now, the King's Indian is Bishop G
seven, allowing E four. And in the GRUNFELD,
you strike with the immediate D five.
I might say, well, the big problem
let's just do that night F six, knight
C. White is going to play D four.
No, white's not going to play D Four.
White's going to play E four. And GRUNFELD
players often get move ordered like this,
and you've got move ordered into a King's
Indian, right? You basically have to go
D six. And after D four, you have a King's
Indian,   which by extension, if
you're a King's Indian player, the English
is also not a big problem for you because
you can just go G six or you can go night F
six and G six, and we're basically happy.
Now, white can keep the English flavor
against the King's Indian. And it's actually
quite an annoying opening that's where
white does not advance the pawn to D four,
white keeps the pawn on D three. And
that's partially why I like to play
E five against C four, even though I'm a
lifelong Kings Indian player. So I, uh,
have played the King's Indian set up against
the English. But I really feel that E five
is the principled line.    Um, if you're
a Slav player, you're also experiencing some
problems against C four. The
slav is D five, C four
and C six. Does anybody
know why the move C six here?
Like, what is the annoying line
that Slav players have to learn?
On top of, of course,
regular Slav stuff. And we're getting
a little technical here, but nonetheless,  
what does white do here to try to move order
black into a line they don't know? Yeah, E
four.   And after
E,    it
transposes after D four into a
panov caro khan. Into
a Panov caro khan,  
it reaches the same exact move order as
after Ce four. C 64, d five takes
takes. In C four, you get the same exact
position. So if you're a Slough player and
you want to play C six, you also have to
learn the pan off, which is not a big
problem to learn. And black is doing totally
fine. But you just have to keep these things
in mind. And I think the easiest way to
avoid all of that is just to learn E five,
to invest some time and learn this move, and
it exposes you to a whole set of positions.
Okay?    Panov is not a problem. Black is
equal in the pano. But you have to know
theory. It can be very dangerous if you
don't know theory. So what we're not going
to do is delve deeply into all of white's
English setups. I'm just going to introduce
them to you. Apart from G three,
which our opponent played, there is the
Four Nights English knight F three.
And here, if we face this, we're going to
play a super cool line that I'm going to
introduce to you that starts with E four.
This is a very modern line. It's, uh,
a pawn sacrifice and it's really
only recently arrived on the scene. But
traditionally, Black plays Knights e six.
And here the classical four nights. English
is e three. You might have seen me with
White play E four a lot. This is a recent
move that's really arrived on the scene.
And the idea, as I talked about in the
previous stream actually is bishop Z
five, the center fork trick 95,
95, and D four.  
And let's see who paid attention in the
previous speedrun. If Black plays bishop D
six, he's already losing.  
Why is Black already losing here?
    Because of the move C
four. C five, and Black's
minor pieces just collapse,
just cave in. 
 So there's all this stuff, but G three is
still considered the most popular. And we
play D five reaching
essentially a reverse Sicilian. This
is an incredibly well studied
opening. There is a lot of theory here, but
it's quite easy to understand the
main setup for Black,  
which is why I'm choosing this is my
official recommendation. So after bishop B
seven, I'm going to plug this into
chess base,   uh, so
that I don't give you any inaccurate
information.     But,
uh, to my knowledge, the move
E three here  
is not particularly
effective. Let me check how many times it's
been played. It's been played a handful of
times and even by some strong players. But
it's not dangerous.  It's not
a topical line. The main line
continues D three,    black,
of course, castles, kingside.  
And here already there is a bit of a fork in
the road. There's a three preparing b
four. And there's bishop C one to E
three. This is the typical square for
White's dark squared bishop just by process
of elimination. Now by popularity.
The main line is A three. And here I'm just
going to introduce this line by showing you
the next couple moves. You play bishop
e six. So you actually don't
play A five. You allow white
to play? B four. And here
you carry out a very cool trick. We play the
move A five.   Now, what the heck
is Black doing? Black's just blundering a
pond. B five, N
four and 965. Looks like we've
just blundered away a central pond. What's
funny is that David Howell, the grandmaster,
he played this against me and he beat me
with with White in this line. But
this is an exchange sacrifice that most
people will stumble into unwittingly
black's move here is Bishop to F
six and suddenly White experiences major
problems   with, uh, his
Knights. Because if knight F
three, then you take and you
take on C three and you win a piece.
The knight is nowhere else to go.
Um, so White has to support it with F
four. If White plays bishop F four,
black is a very pretty move
and a very important idea
to know anytime you have this
construction, especially if there's a pawn
on G three, what move do you have to
remember    black to play
and win? If you're watching on YouTube,
pause and figure this out. It's worth
your while. G five chases the
bishop away and wins a piece.
Very good. So white has to play
them of F four.  
Now,   black, uh,  plays bishop E
five, Fe five, and knight to B three. This
is the crux  of Black's idea
because if the rook moves, then, uh, you
have queen to D four. Check forking
the knight and the king. So actually, what
black has to do, what David Howell,  
uh, did, is just bishop C one to E
three. You have to COVID the D four square
and sack the exchange. But
according to modern engines, and I analyzed
this, black has to move nine, P 60, D five.
You're trying to force trades because you're
up in exchange, and only black can be
better here. There are some correspondence
games here.  Um, there are some OTB
games. One of them continued bishop Ah,
 C five, rookie eight,  
and a guy named Jensen,
24 70. Im m played
94. But it turns out after a simple
move like queen d seven, black is incredibly
solid in the center.   
Um, another OTB
game continued a four,
and now very strong, would have been just to
solidify your queen sight structure with B
six,   bishop D four. And
now to throw in another prophylactic, H
six to prevent the knight from jumping
into D five. And then you go rook D eight.
Or you can go rook AC eight. And
eventually Bishop H three. Black,
essentially, is the only side having
fun here. So we went quite deep.
But it's important to know this line,
because if White doesn't know what to do
after night D four, he's very likely
to take on E five. Now, instead,
   in this position,
the main line is knight
back to D two, covering
the B three score. White can also play rugby
one. This is second in
popularity, and this leads to some very
interesting positions. So, for example,
after 92, uh, black
kind of eats into White's
structure with C six. This is the
theoretical move BC knight
C six. And already I would argue that you
can play this move OTB with Black. Like, you
can know only this and you're already going
to be fine. The main line
continues rook B one. And now black
cements the weakness on a three by
pushing the pawn up to a four. Another very
typical move in such structures.
And then you go rook C eight. And
quickly you can reposition your knife back
to d four and even make your way to B three.
It's an easy position to play. And I really
think that unless White is super familiar
with typical plans and structures, it's easy
for White to fall into passive mode and
get a worse position. The engine just
gives basically zeros everywhere
here.   Last thing I'll
say in this position is that if White
plays rook B one, then
you actually need to defend the E five fund.
Now, it is a threat that you can do so by
pushing F six. Remember that if you have a
bishop on this diagonal, f six is not
nearly as weakening as
it would otherwise be. And
now again, the main move is knight D two,
played by Carlson and others. If White plays
knight to 64, then of course, you
recapture with upon to clamp
down on white's queenside.
Knight to A four, bishop to D
five, trading off the fianceto bishop.
And black is doing totally fine.
So this is a very short elevator pitch. Kind
of overview of the main lines
here. There are sidelines. White can play
the immediate A three. B three
is quite popular as
well. But, uh, for the time
being, let's switch back to what our
opponent played, e three.    Okay?
Any questions about that?
Let's see what people are saying. I'm
reading the chat.      
 Jeffrey says there's a super GM subtlety.
After you through, you'll have to explain.
So we castle, we allow the move D four, and
we take it and we reach this
position. Now, of course, as I pointed out
during the game,   um, there is
the possibility of playing night 64. And
by the way, I hate to jump around too much,
but I did promise that I'll show
you why the English can be
dangerous if black plays kind of
nonchalant developing move. So let's rewind
a little bit and talk about that for a
second. This is important. So let's say the
black plays let's knight C six
and then bishop E seven already.
Black is worse. And the way to
understand this position is to understand
that black no longer is able to push
D five. And if you're not able to push D
five, that basically means you have to
position your pawn on D six. And it's just
passive. It's passive.
White can play this common setup with E
three and 92. This was introduced to me as
the Botanic setup. Uh, we played this with
Black in the Sicilian just a couple of games
ago. And Black has no obvious plan.
Cramped, passive. White has this typical
plan of pushing the beep on forward and
orchestrating some queenside pressure.  
And yeah, you can play this bishop E
six castles. You can
even try to push through D five. But if
you play it down a bunch of tempeh,
you're not going to enjoy yourself. And
White can even counterstrike with D four.
And this gets super, super nasty because you
can't take on C four.   Uh,
so, okay, you can play queen D seven
here, but, uh, after something
like knight to D five, it's it's
unpleasant.   It's
unpleasant. Um,     and and you
should remember that, right? That's why you
need a concrete set up against the English.
There are setups where you actually put your
bishop on C five.   
 Um, and Jeffrey, I'll get to your point in
a second. There are setups where you play
bishop C five, but again, after A three,
you're just biting on granite. And in some
lines, black tucks the bishop away on a
seven for like, a rainy day. I looked at
these setups. I think black is worse
here,  uh, partially because you're actually
allowing the pond to get to d four in one
fell swoop. So these are interesting
setups, but I don't particularly
like them. I don't think they're very sound.
    And and I think the way you
should play is D five. I'm
pretty insistent on that. So we will,
I'm sure, face this again and we will talk
more about theory. And Jeffrey is making
a very interesting point. So, after T
four, e D four, apparently the
move knight takes D four
was very strong.  
Very interesting point. Why is the
move night D four  
so strong? Well, let's figure it out.
Well, my plan was to play night takes D
four. I suppose white plays E
takes D four. And the crux of the
matter is that after we
play C six to halt
the progress of the deep on, can
anybody tell me what very
scary move white now has at his
disposal? And this is the entire reason that
you move the knight, uh, from F three in the
first place. And this should be obvious,
right? Because at this point, you should
have a pretty good grasp of what each side
wants.   Yeah,
phenomenamaster has it right. Black white
plays D five.   They might say, well, why
is D five so dangerous? Well, first of all,
white is eradicating his weakness, the
IQP. But what often happens is that once
the IQP is eliminated, the
dam breaks and the side of
the more active pieces is going to benefit.
Now, which side is the more active pieces?
Well, it's clearly white, and it's because
of the placement of this lightscored bishop.
Black's lightscored bishop is still on its
developing square. So if
you forecast a bunch of trades here
after knight takes D five, I actually think
I can even take back with the queen.   Um, 
maybe I can take with the bishop. But that
endgame is quite unpleasant for black. The
engine does give equality here with, ah,
precise play,   black needs to
quickly put the other bishop on F six to to
do the same thing to white that white is
doing to black. But nonetheless, you can see
that it's a little bit it's a little bit
iffy. And maybe maybe white should play
bishop takes D five. Maybe this is the way
to fight for an advantage. And after bishop
f six, maybe the queen can come out to F
three, the rook to D one. And white is a bit
of an initiative that should sort of make
sense to intuitively. So D. Five
is actually unstoppable here. And you can't
bring your bishop out because you drop B
seven. Right? So these subtleties are
important to appreciate. And that is why,
according to Jeffrey, bishop E six here
was actually more precise than castling,
because now, if White plays D
four, who can explain to me
what the difference is in this
position?   And now you should have the
AHA moment. Everything should kind of
click. What does black do here?
    Not
95. 95 is premature. You don't need
to occupy the square. You don't need to
occupy the square to control it. Controlling
it is more important.   C
six. Exactly. You play C six now, and D
five is no longer possible because the
bishop is an added defender of that
square.    Not queen c eight.
Guys. Queen C eight allows exactly what
white wants. It allows the pond to move
forward.   You need to control that square.
Now, why is 95 bad here?
Well, 95 is bad because you're biting off
more than you can chew. And you can
basically get Stein and Bart eleven
after takes in rookie one. I'm referencing
a famous game where black
encountered similar problems on the E
file and was never able to castle. 
 And, um,  thank you, Jeffrey, for this
point. This was a very instructive point,
and you're getting introduced right now to
basically GM level opening theory and, like,
how things work. But what you
should take away from this is that
everything can be understood, right? It's
not like, oh, bishop E six is better because
it is. It's better for a specific
reason that you can carve out with enough
analysis and persistence.   
So, in any case, we're
getting deep here. Let's get into the middle
game. We play bishop E six, white doesn't
play. Knight takes D four, and we breathe a
sigh of relief. Okay, so bishop F
six, I think, is   a, uh,
reasonable move to attack D four. There
were other ways we could play. We could put
the night on D five. We could play the
immediate night before and night before to D
five. I'm sure if you look with an engine,
bishop F six probably not the best
move   to echo the
line I was talking about, 94 is what I
was really worried about. What's up, chest
kid? 94 is what I was worried about. And
here we were calculating bishop D 494,
and we concluded that 94 is very
imprecise on account of this nasty little
move. Knight to C five,  
attacking B seven and B six,
and everything is kind of hanging in the
air. But queen D four breathes new life into
this line,    um, because
if white takes and plays 95 now, there's
this fork. This is the line I was
referencing during the game. Now, you should
see it,      
  but in this position, it's
really not the end of the story. And White
can play a move like queen no, not queen G
four, but queen h five. And I believe
that white has a very powerful
initiative in response
in exchange for the pond. I mean, there's
niq five ideas. According to the engine,
black is totally fine after the crazy
F six to stop niq five, but
this is scary. I mean, the queen is
vulnerable. White's pieces look very active.
It leads to complications. It leads to a
super complicated game. If you're
interested, you can surf around with an
engine. But I don't want to get too bogged
down in the complications, because bishop e
three is what really anybody under
2200 would play
automatically and knight to B four,
preparing to increase our control over D
five, a three by our opponent, which I
think is inaccurate because it sends the
night where it wants to go anyway.   I think
the correct move would have indeed been to
play 94. Once again, we would have
dropped our bishop back to E seven,  
and perhaps white can play
95. We go. Bishop d five.
  Maybe now it's time to
chase the night out of B four. Since it
can't get to D five, we would have dropped
back I 96 wonders the pond. Uh 
    huh. So this would have been
a nasty little way to play, would have
forced us to play night A    six. And
of course,   now we
have been forced to ruin our queen
side pod structures at the end of the world
no. Because we still have this big
blockading piece on D five, but white can
play 95 and keep piling it
on. And despite the fact that white's trades
is fianceto bishop, with the queen coming to
f uh, three and the knight to C six, you can
sense that white's pieces are a lot
more active here. So
these types of positions you want to try to
avoid. I think after 94,
white maintains a small 
 advantage.   
   Okay. But that's very,
very deep stuff. And a three is intuitive.
White plays it now, but
now, after night C five, this
has lost a lot of its effectiveness because
we can take on a three, and then
we can take on C five. And this is what I
was discussing during the game. After night
C four, with or without
queen takes D one. I think black is doing
fine. White's pawns are quite 
 damaged, and it's not so easy to
keep everything under wraps here if you're
   white.
Um, so in any
case, I think things really started going
well. Things went wrong in the span of just
a single move. I still think here
that if white plays the careful bishop
C one, white is not worse and the engine
gives zeros, which I think is pretty
reasonable. I mean, black has we've gained a
bunch of tempi right, with
white deliing around on the kingside. But
even if white just says sorry, as my
old coach would say, just, I'm going to go
back. Sorry. White is still very
solid, right? White is still fundamentally
sound here, as is Black. And
the game takes on a very positional
character. Here, the engine recommends a
simple look to move like H Six,
even 95 back to F Six is interesting to make
space for the other night and try to trade
off some pieces. When you're playing against
an IQP, you'd normally want to trade
minor pieces because the fewer pieces are
  left, the harder it
is to, ah, apportion resources because
something has to defend the IQP. So if you
don't have a lot of pieces left, you might
end up just forcing all of your remaining
pieces to defend the isolated queen pond.
There's a great car puff corchnoy game on
this topic that I've shown before on
stream won't do it. Now, Knight C Five is
the engine line, and there is a
train on C five. The structure
changes and you get a very unclear endgame
with both sides kind of having their share
of   activity. And Jeffrey makes an
important point, which is that it is
psychologically very difficult for really,
any player, but especially newer
players, to play these types of retreating
moves and admit that you messed up. And this
is a big takeaway from this game
if you're, uh, considering learning from
White's perspective. It's like
when you have sense that you just
messed up, right? Let's say you fell into a
one move. Itis kind of trap. You made a move
that you thought was cool, and then you
immediately realized that you've just
twisted yourself into a knot. Your
first instinct should be to it should be
self preservation. You should make sure to
identify the threats and then just make sure
you're not losing any pieces and do whatever
it takes. Right. Because I think White's
problem is that he just sort of panicked.
He's like, oh, this didn't work out the way
I wanted it to. And then you short circuit.
But rather than short circuit and you say,
well, what specifically is Black's threat?
Well, if you ask yourself that question, you
should notice that it's night E Three and
Bishop G Five. Well, how do we prevent it?
Well, you can do it from two different ends.
You can move the night away. You can move
the Bishop way. The night is no good squares
because night F Three just happens to
blunder the night. I suppose night H Three
is the way to to defend your minor
pieces. But it goes without saying that this
is ridiculously awkward, and Black
is better. And so that really
only leaves the option of moving the
Bishop away. Why not? Bishop D two. Because
it cuts   contact between,   uh,
the queen and the pawn. But it's also
possible and it invites a move like
Night C Four and Bishop C One is the
best move, both according to the engine and
according to what we 
  discussed. Um, apparently, according
to Leila, bishop D Two is good, and even the
move Queen to f Three
is not so bad. Attacking
the Bishop. And the idea is to meet Knight
takes C three with oh, actually, F
takes C three. Uh huh.
And you're counterattacking the Bishop
on  F five. This may seem to
win a piece, but remember, the very night
that's being attacked can also do
  the capturing, not to be forgotten about.
And it's a    
complicated position. So, in this game
analysis, we're doing kind of a lot of open
ended analysis and digging around. And this
might strike you as boring and aimless, but
hopefully this is helping you formulate
a better understanding of these complex
positions. You never know when these ideas
can come in   handy. So,
this was an open ended game. It's hard to
make any hard and fast conclusions, but I
still think just analyzing deeply like this,
it helps you acquire ideas and
achieve fluency in complicated situations.
Now, once the piece was blundered, I'm not
going to talk too much about the rest of the
game. I'm just going to make a couple
of clarifications. Bishop g six here
allows   h four. And funnily
enough, after Bishop F Six, black
is actually getting away with it.
Black is getting away with it because
after H five, we can play Queen Takes
D Four. And once the Queen is
knocked out, the Bishop can then capture H
five. But that's luck. And after E Five,
Bishop E seven, the Bishop now has a
retreat, uh, not a retreating score, but an
escape square on     F
five. All right. And so
Bishop G Six did
work, but we played a more conservative
move, a safer move. And I also think the top
move, and yeah, uh, 92
is    kind of giving the
game a whale. The game has already been
given away. If I was playing White, I would
have probably tried to muddy the waters. But
this is still completely lost. I mean, this
is just a free piece. Actually, Bishop C Six
might be inaccurate due to D Five,
which I missed. So perhaps
here we should instead play pawn to C
Six and really establish our control
over this light square, and then bring the
Bishop back to E six and the night to
D five. Yeah.   My
apologies,  Bishop. Um, C six
was   indeed
imprecise. 92. We found this nice tactical
move, C Five, carving out the
weak, dark square. And this
is just a sort of stock
idea that you should be aware of on a
very conceptual level.
It occurs very commonly
in, uh, every opening. It's a
universal idea. But if I had to give you
a simple example of an opening where an idea
like this occurs
super frequently, it is the Karo Khan.
So take a look at
a very simple illustration of
 this concept by none other
than Alipon himself. And here you
will see why players in the
18 hundreds   
 often struggled, um, because they
were often unfamiliar with
sort of  
basic positional concepts, stuff that
we now kind of take  
for granted. So take a
quick gander at   this
game. This is a simple illustration of
this concept in wearing
different clothes. Essentially, Marco
against Alappen, two leading players of the
   18     
hundreds. Um, so in this position,
it's an isolated sorry, it's an obstacle
of   bishop endgame. And white
plays   the move. C three.
C four. How do you think Alipon responds?
Let's see who's paying   
 attention to the
  general concept. Now. Uh, you identify the
square you want to carve out. Very good. B
six. B five. Excellent.
And Marco goes right into Black Sands. He
plays C five, and he
yields this incredible
square on D five. Right? This is just, um
now, White is an equivalent square on
D six. But the thing is, white put
the knight there the night on D six.
It just looks good. It doesn't actually
do anything. The lords over the
entire position, and Black ends up winning
the game by using the knight directly to
break through on the queenside to create a
passed pawn. And then he accumulates
his pieces there, and he ends up winning the
game. And eventually, the knight is replaced
by a bishop. So the D 
 five square is an integral part of the
way in which Alipin wins this game.
Nowadays, people would kind of
automatically, if we rewind,  lean,
uh, toward B three and not yield the square.
Now, Black and take and go B five with the
other pawn. And here I would go, rookie C
one. And if you think about it, in this
case, the effect of the D five square is
still intense, but it's diminished because
Black has to reckon with the weakness of the
C six pawn. And
it's     diluted, essentially. Uh, but
I can show you a zillion examples of this. I
call this carving out. You're carving out
a square. And we did something
very similar here with the move C five,
just wearing different clothes.  
Once again, um, if D five,
which happened in the game, we get this
monster E five square.
If DC, then we come around, we pick up
the pawn, and with the open D file, we're
going to move our bishop away and why it's
going to collapse very quickly. So, D
five, knight C four, bishop back
to F six, controlling
E five, winning the pawn on B
two, and dropping the bishop back to
E five. Keeping our eyes on the prize, not
fearing Ruth. B seven, pushing the pawn.
Now, the plan is very simple. You're going
to push it all the way. Queen h five.
Uh, f six. A simple defensive move
protecting the bishop with a pawn. And now
a little operation to force the queen trade.
Bishop H three and Queen C eight. And again,
if rook D seven here trying to intercept it.
Rook to F seven ends the game because the
queen is undefended. There's no check on
D eight. There's no queen E six because it's
just queen takes d seven, and this loses the
queen. And so White loses the
game takes takes c
three. And of course, White
hastens defeat. But if White had gone rook c
two, we would have followed through with our
plan rook   f seven. And then there's a
million ways to win, but I like the move
even rook to c four. Just go after the e
four pawn win both of White's pawns, and
the bishop is more than
capable of defending c three all
by its lonesome. It's also protecting the b
eight square. So White doesn't even have
this check. And the moment White moves the
rook away, you push the pawn. Classic kind
of     concept. 
 Okay, so this ends the game, and
the rest is clear
without commentary. That was a
rich game. That was a good game. I hope you
enjoyed the analysis. A lot to take
away from this. There's a lot of takeaways
in the opening and a lot
of takeaways positionally, which I won't
reiterate because there were a lot of
specific things. But, uh, I hope you've come
away with the feeling that you're more
comfortable with these types of positions,
especially IQP structures. Thanks, Jeffrey,
for all the insight. This was
super fun. And, uh, thanks again to the
